# Kinetic and Arrhenius Analysis Using Python

This repository contains a computational mini research project analyzing chemical reaction kinetics and temperature dependence using Python.

## Overview
- Determination of reaction order using integrated rate laws
- Calculation of rate constants from ln[A] vs time plots
- Arrhenius analysis to extract activation energy
- Statistical validation using R²

## Key Results
- First-order kinetics confirmed (R² ≈ 0.99995)
- Activation energy: 60.3 kJ/mol (R² ≈ 0.99901)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

## Files Included
- Kinetic_and_Arrhenius_Mini_Research_Report.pdf — full mini research report
- kinetic_arrhenius_analysis.ipynb — Python notebook with code, plots, and calculations

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data analysis and plotting
